# EvolutionGenerator

EvolutionGenerator is project for my IT studies. 

It simulates the animals and enviroment. 

The world consist jungle and grasslands where grass spawns (there is more probability that grass spawns in jungle). 

At the start of the simulation the animals are spawned. They can move in eight directions, which they choose randomly.

If the animal come in a field with a grass, it eats it and gain energy. Every day animal loses energy and if energy is negative, it dies.

Every animal has his own genotype. 

Animals can copulate if they stand on the same field. Their child inherit 1/3 genotype from one parent and 2/3 from another.
